<h1>Hello, and thank you for this opportunity!</h1><br><br>
<hr><br><br>
<p>First and foremost, I want to express how grateful I am for this opportunity. This has been a fun and surprisingly deep project, and if nothing else I had a blast building it! Secondly, I wanted to let y'all know that I am hosting this on netlify to make it easier to view in production. That is at this URL:<a href='https://kind-swirles-af987d.netlify.app/' target='_blank'>. One other note, is that I based this project off of an instance of the "create-react-app" npm command. I hope that is alright!</p><br><br>
<p>Next I am listing my time spent on each task below, these times are approximate:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Whiteboarding, and general set up: 2hrs</li>
    <li>Create SearchConditions and FilterDetails components: 3hrs</li>
    <li>Style SearchConditions and FilterDetails components: 2hrs</li>
    <li>Add and remove individual filter functionality: 2.5hrs</li>
    <li>Build and style the search & reset buttons and results section: < 1hr</li>
    <li>Reset button functionality: 1hr</li>
    <li>Search button functionality: 2hrs</li>
    <li>Animations: 1hr</li>
    <li>Attempting to style select elements (unsuccessful, see below): 1hr</li>
    <li>Review and polish: 1hr</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally I had one last note. Regarding the styling of the select elements, it has always been my understanding that it is largely impossible without making a dropdown out of other semantically correct html elements. I futzed around with it for about an hour and couldn't find any resources that suggested otherwise so I left it as is (my personal preference is towards using semantically correct HTML as it aids accesibility), but if there are methods you all know of I would love to learn about them!</p><br><br>
<p>Thank you once more,<br>Patrick</p>
